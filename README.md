- **Homework 1 (Scripting)**: Lua, Python, JavaScript
- **Due 9/13**
 # For the first assigment we were tasked with coding in Lua, javascript, and ptyhon. All containing the same problems just in the said language. Those problems being a lowercase version of a string being returned is the first element is satisfied, goes up to certain base power that can't exceed the given power, a fucntion that gives back chainable strings to form a sentence or phrase,  function that looks through a file and retunrs anything that is empty, nor made up of whitespace or if the first whitespace character is #, and a class representing Quaternions that can be used in computations with other instances of Quaternions
- **Homework 2 (Enterprise)**: Java, Kotlin, Swift
# In our second assignment we were tasked with writing in Java, Kotlin, and Swift. In these languages we had to write functions that could return an item that meets a condition in an optional type, chain toghter bits of a sentence, return chracters from a file that are or are not made up of whitespace, a quaternion of which all objects created should be immutable and generic binary search tree.
- **Homework 3 (Theory)**: TypeScript, OCaml, Haskell
# With the third assignment we were working with Haskell, TypeScript, and ocaml. Within these languages we had to write functions that could return an item that meets a condition in an optional type,raise an exponent to a power of that given base, return chracters from a file that are or are not made up of whitespace, a way to compute boxes or spheres via multiplying their length, width, and height, and generic binary search tree.
- **Homework 4 (Systems)**: C, C++, Rust
- **Homework 5 (Concurrency)**: Go
